# Sales Enquiry Database & Dashboard Development Project
## Comprehensive Project Documentation

### Executive Summary

The Sales Enquiry Database & Dashboard Development project aims to transform FCL's current ad-hoc enquiry tracking system into a robust, centralized database with comprehensive performance dashboards. This MERN stack-based web application will replace the existing Excel-based system, providing real-time insights, data consistency, and role-based access control for sales and management teams.

### Project Overview

**Problem Statement:** FCL currently lacks a robust database, tracking mechanism, and performance dashboard for sales enquiries across different market segments and product groups. The existing system suffers from data inconsistency, limited accessibility, and poor performance visibility.

**Solution:** Develop a web-based Sales Enquiry Management System using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that provides:
- Centralized enquiry database
- Real-time performance dashboards
- Role-based access control
- Data analytics and KPI tracking
- Automated reporting capabilities

### Current Data Analysis

Based on the provided sample data analysis:

#### Key Statistics
- **Total Enquiries Tracked:** 428 enquiries
- **Date Range:** April 2025 to September 2025
- **Closure Rate:** 59.58%
- **Average Fulfillment Time:** 2.05 days
- **Market Distribution:** 214 Domestic vs 43 Export enquiries
- **Success Rate:** 218 Quoted vs 33 Regretted enquiries

#### Team Performance
- **Primary R&D Handler:** SANTOSH (229 enquiries - 53.5%)
- **Primary Sales Representative:** MALINI (98 enquiries - 22.9%)
- **R&D Team:** 4 members (SANTOSH, SUSHILA, DEELIP, VINOD)
- **Sales Team:** 11 members across various product lines

#### Data Quality Observations
- Product types need standardization (SP, NSP, combinations)
